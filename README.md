# IT-Concepts-Work


Firstly, I connected the two computers to the router. Then I connected the computers to the printer. I drew the arrows coming from the computer because you would use 
the computer to connect to those devices. I then connected the printer to the router because the printer needs a Wi-Fi connection if you were to print wirelessly. 
The arrows going back to the computer complete the loop of communication between printer and computer.
